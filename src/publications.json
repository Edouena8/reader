    "text": "The nutrition story of omega-3 fatty acids is quickly evolving and recent research demonstrates their expanded role in supporting both physical and mental health.  This curated virtual issue of 11 recent articles from Nutrition Reviews includes the newest information on the role that omega-3 fatty acids play in health. The perspectives presented in this virtual issue include how omega-3 fatty acids support healthy pregnancy outcomes (Satokar et al 2021) and their chronotropic effect related to the resting heart rate (Zhang 2022). The systematic reviews focus on the clinical importance of omega-3 fatty acids (Musa-Veloso et al 2018; Camargo et al 2018; Chen et al 2020), their role in lipid metabolism (Conway et al 2020), a comparison between different sources of omega-3 fatty acids on metabolism (Kim et al 2020) and how fish oil supplements are associated with the preservation of lean body mass with exercise (Heileson et al 2020).  The three meta-analyses included in this issue are on sleep (Dai et al 2021), peripheral nerve health (Zhang et al 2019) and what their role may be in preventing cognitive decline in adults (Alex et al 2019).  We hope you find this issue to be a quick way to update your knowledge on omega-3 fatty acids."

    "title": "Virtual Issue: Stress, Sleep, and Nutrition",
    "text": "Recent advances in nutrition research have revealed a series of complex mechanisms that help explain how nutrients and other bioactive compounds from food directly and indirectly affect brain metabolism, mood, sleep, and cognition. In light of this, Nutrition Reviews’ Editor-in-Chief, Douglas Taren, PhD, MS, has curated a virtual issue of scientific reviews that highlight the biochemical mechanisms of nutrition that affect mental health and associated chronic diseases. Together the collection of articles provide a robust look at the strength of associations between nutrition, stress, sleep, mental health, and gaps in the research that need to be filled in order to develop appropriate nutrition interventions and guidance for nutrition policies and programs. We invite you to enjoy the selection of articles below, freely available through July 2021."
